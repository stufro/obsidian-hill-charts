## Installation
You can install this plugin using the [Obsidian BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin.

## Usage
Once installed, you can define a hillchart in a code block like this:

```
```hillchart
points:
  - position: 30
    text: Admin Dashboard
  - position: 85
    text: User Auth
  - position: 65
    text: Subscriptions
Â ```
```

There are 5 available options you can pass to each point:
```
- position: 30
  text: Admin Dashboard
  color: "#fb3590"
  size: 15
  opacity: 0.5
```

The default size and opacity can be configured in the plugin settings.

## Contributing
